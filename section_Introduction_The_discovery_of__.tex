\section{Introduction}

The discovery of Fast Radio Bursts, a new class of millisecond-duration, highly-dispersed radio transients, has opened a whole new playground in astrophysics. 

- Physical processes

- Utility as probes

- Repeater as anomalous FRB

- VLA data provides new insight on role of repeater in overall FRB population
