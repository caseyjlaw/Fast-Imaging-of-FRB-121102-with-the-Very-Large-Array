The highly-dispersed, millisecond radio transients known as Fast Radio Bursts have recently emerged as a new class...
The discovery of repeating bursts from FRB121102 has shown that at least some FRBs are not cataclysmic and opened potential for studying a homogenous sample of bursts...
Our recent coordinated campaign with the Very Large Array and Arecibo Observatory has made the first direct, arcsecond-scale localization of an FRB and unambiguously associated it with counterparts in other observations. This campaign detected nine bursts at the VLA from 2.5 to 3.5~GHz and many more at Arecibo near 1.4~GHz. The coordination of these observations allow us to refine our picture of the physical processes in FRB121102. 
With so many bursts, we can make the first reliable measures of burst flux distribution and temporal statistics...
The connection of FRB121102 to the overall population...
