\section{Observations}

All observations in August and Septmeber were searched in quasi real-time by a prototype version of \emph{realfast}. \emph{realfast} is a real-time, fast imaging transient search system. The current, prototype runs on existing hardware of the VLA correlator backend, while the future \emph{realfast} will run on a dedicated GPU cluster.

Burst detections and localizations were made within hours of data being recorded.
