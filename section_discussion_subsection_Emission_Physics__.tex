\subsection{Emission Physics and Burst Energetics}



\subsection{Connection to Overall FRB Population}

Flat luminosity distribution of FRB121102 and overall population

Constraints on repetition assuming "red spectrum"

\subsection{Observing Strategies}

Targeting known FRBs is optimal

Wide, low-sensitivity searches are best way to conduct a blind search
